            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>Foodie is a community built by and for sharing Recipes: The cooks who will dedicate the weekend to a perfect beef bourguignon but love the simplicity of a slow-cooker rendition, too. The bakers who labor over a showstopping 9-layer cake but will just as happily doctor boxed brownies for a decadent weeknight dessert.</p> 
            <p>The entertainers who just want a solid snack spread, without tons of dirty dishes at the end of the night.</p>
            <p>Most importantly, Foodie connects home cooks with their greatest sources of inspiration â€” other home cooks. We're here to share recipes between all our users, and that inspires us to do everything possible to keep our community connected. Our dear home cooks deserve no less.</p>
